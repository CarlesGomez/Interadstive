#Interadstive IoT solution Overview
Interadstive IoT is a solution to make the interaction between a person and his enviroment devices easier and more natural, based on the person actions with the said enviroment.

## How it works
![alt tag](http://www.sompartyapp.com/smart_ads/img/tecnologia.jpg)

The android application tracks the places where the user has been during the day or in the past and his social media interactions. Then, we push the collected data to the cloud and, applying big data analytics, we determine an user profile.
Based on that, we make the devices, with a javascript web application loaded, to interact with the user using proximity technology (in this example we focused on beacon bluetooth lte).
 
## Demo case in FutureHacks Madrid
You can download the android application to your device with android 4.3+ OS installed and bluetooth 4.0 compatibility.
After that, you log in with Facebook to get the user social media interests and the device starts to track the places (in this case we send the data to our own database, but you could use an IBM Bluemix Data and adapt the data that you want to analyse).

Then you put a beacon at the back of a touch TV, tablet or any dive with a screen where you can use a browser to load [this webapp](http://www.sompartyapp.com/smart_ads/ad/).

Finally, you go close to the screen with the attached beacon and you can interact with it.

In the demo, we adapted it to retail allowing the client to [segment and configure the ads](http://www.sompartyapp.com/smart_ads/) enable a personalized consumer shop experience.
